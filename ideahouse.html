	<p>Almost 80 years ago, on the ground adjacent to the current entrance to the Walker Art Center’s parking garage, an idea was built. Opened to the public in 1941, Idea House I was one of two fully functioning houses built on Vineland Place during that decade. The Idea Houses extended the museum experience beyond the walls of the Walker’s building, and made spatial their agenda to bring art and people together. These domestic design exhibitions were critical in the Walker’s project of introducing Modern design to Minneapolis. The Idea House series sought to provide architectural ideas to an audience; the social context of the 1940s dictated the limits of the project’s accessibility.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In the early 1940s, the American domestic economy was still recovering from the Great Depression, which had prompted an extreme housing shortage. World War II raised the cost of residential construction from an estimated 40 cents to $1 per cubic foot, as building materials were diverted to the war effort. As WWII continued, practicality became a necessity for the art and design world. The straightforward, unadorned design of early Modernism flourished in part due to this cultural climate; the Walker Art Center’s vision to bring art and people together shared a similar practical mandate</p>
	<p>The Walker Art Gallery, founded in 1879 by lumber baron Thomas Barlow Walker, took a turn in 1938 when the Minnesota Art Council (MAC) contacted Daniel S. Defenbacher to begin the process of forming an alliance between public and private entities that would come to comprise the Walker Art Center. MAC, supported by the director of the Walker Art Gallery (a descendant of the baron), raised funds from Minneapolis citizens for a community art center. Defenbacher leveraged knowledge from his previous role with the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) for funding from the WPA to support art center staff. The Walker Art Gallery donated their facility and collection to the effort, and the Walker Art Center was thus established in 1939, with Defenbacher as its first director. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Defenbacher focused exhibition efforts towards architecture and design, more specifically what he would come to call “useful art”  - a principle of industrial design in the Modern era that posits design as the way an object is elevated from a product to an art form. The innovative, full-scale Idea House I was one such design experiment in useful art.</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<p>The Idea House series was intended to provide exhibition-goers with concepts they could implement in their own homes - an innovative design brief that perhaps necessitated the degree of anonymity in the design, so the viewer may superimpose their own lives into the design.  This participatory spectacle included, embedded within the design and concept, the potent symbol of the family; the single-family home is used as marketing for the importance, relevance, and usefulness of Modern design. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The architecture of domesticity is central to the Modernist project. Throughout the 20th century, the home was the site for the elaboration of Modernist architectural ideas, beginning in 1925 with Le Corbusier’s Pavilion de l’Esprit Nouveau in the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs. The single family home served as a convenient scale that Modernist architects used to convey their ideas. Several exhibition homes were built, including George Fred Keck’s House of Tomorrow in the 1933 Chicago Century of Progress International Exposition, but Idea House I was the first to be built by a museum. Its opening in 1941 predated the popular Case Study House program in Los Angeles, begun in 1944 by Arts & Architecture magazine. The scale of the single family home was further convenient to demonstrate and popularize Modern design to a wider audience - the scale is familiar and necessary to everyday people. Importantly, the Walker’s Idea Houses were constructing a home for the present, not the future.</p>
	<br>
	<p>By 1946, the War was over. As military men returned home, the anticipation of a leisurely peacetime American lifestyle was high. The 1944 Servicemen's Readjustment Act provided veterans with low interest, zero down payment home loans, encouraging the construction of new suburban homes. This legislation, combined with a booming market for consumer and construction products, thanks to wartime technical innovations, accelerated the traditional aspiration of home ownership. However, the Act was administered by individual state governments - one of the many factors that spurred the Great Migration, the relocation of millions of Black Americans from the Jim Crow South to the urban North. In spite of the alluring promise of home ownership, discriminatory lending policies and neighborhood redlining was prevalent in Northern Cities. The Twin Cities were growing, but housing options for Americans of color were not.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In September 1947, when the second of the Walker’s Idea Houses opened, the country was still one year away from the 1948 Shelley v. Kramer case that made racial housing covenants unenforceable, and six years before the Minnesota Legislature explicitly prohibited the use of racial restrictions in deed in 1953. Despite these legislative efforts, discriminatory housing practices were not outlawed until the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It is through this societal context  that the “useful art” of the Idea House series must be evaluated. The aim of the Idea House series to offer visitors ideas to propagate their own domestic bliss implicitly left out large portions of the population. The design intent, as articulated by curator Andrew Blauvet in the Walker’s 2000 exhibition revisiting the Idea Houses, was to draw on the rhetoric of Yankee ingenuity, designing with a practical utility that appealed to American aspirations of freedom and individuality. The motivation of “useful art” in the Idea House series, to elevate domestic life to an art form through good design, tacitly avoids the social context of race; the inverse, whereby through acceptance and education of design, art is democratized and made available to a majority of the population, is explicitly false in this context. While the Idea House series publicized Modernism in Minneapolis, the avenues for adherence to a Modernist domestic lifestyle were limited for many Minneapolitians.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Idea House II was a more ambitious iteration of the prior in every way. Designed by William Friedman and Hilde Reiss, the design brief of this second Idea House was vastly different from the first, with a focus on growing families, rather than maximum affordability. In 1947, GIs were returning home from World War II to begin the baby boom; the implied resident of the both Idea Houses are a heterosexual couple with young children, a prescriptive ideal made spatial in the design. The population of Minneapolis was growing - between 1940 and 1950, Minneapolis gained 29,000 citizens, an increase of 6%. Affordability was nevertheless still a goal, as construction costs remained high after the war. Idea House II used modest finishes and innovative design solutions meant to use space efficiently. Expanded partnerships with brands for architectural technologies and products subsidized the cost of construction for the Walker Art Center, but the price tag was more than $20,000 (not including land and furnishings) - a hefty sum for families of the era, and more than 150% the cost of Idea House I.  Idea House II was sponsored by the home institute of the Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis - another demonstration of the exhibition’s marketing to white homeowners in the Twin Cities.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Idea House II is designed into the natural slope of the plot, with an entry at ground level, below the main mass of the house. The upper levels are split into two wings, both oriented to face the garden in the south. In the west wing, a 4-in-1 living area combines programs; the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune described it in 1947 as including an “all purpose family work table, dining-recreation porch, handy kitchen and breakfast bar.” Modernist furniture was trickling into mass production, and with the exception of the built-in pieces, all furniture displayed in Idea House II was available for purchase from manufacturers listed in the brochure. </p>
	<br>
	<p>The list of design features in Idea House II included technical innovations, fashionable furniture, and, of course, experimental architectural ideas. The house was thus marketed like many consumer products of the day: with a list of yearly features, sold anew each year. But like the latest gizmo, some design features would not stand the test of time. The medium of the Idea House series as an exhibition home invited criticism from viewers in a way that art exhibited inside the museum did not. With art, particularly Modern art, the average visitor may not feel confident in their opinions or criticism; everyone who saw the Idea Houses were experts in living in a home, and could evaluate the merits of the design. This may be the ultimate feature in the Idea Houses: the evaluation, in the eyes of the visitors, of the art’s usefulness. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Idea Houses I and II stood on Vineland Place until the construction of the Guthrie Theater, designed by Ralph Rapson, caused the demolition of Idea House I in 1961. In 1969, an expansion of the Guthrie caused the demotion of Idea House II and the end of an era in the Walker’s history with Modernism. The project of Defenbacher, Reiss, the Everyday Art Gallery and the Idea House series to prosthelytize Modern Design was effective in the City: curator Blauvet cited the designs of University Grove, a Modernist residential enclave in Minneapolis, as evidence of the Idea House’s influence. This influence was ultimately inaccessible for many Americans; the design of the Idea House series prescribed an exclusionary vision of the family home, and the success of “useful art” must be evaluated in the social context of the era. With the construction of Edward Larrabee Barnes building for the Walker in 1971, the institution was positioned towards the contemporary era. The Late Modernist design towers over the footprint of where the Idea Houses once stood, now just a memory of the Walker’s first built foray into Modernism, and a useful case study of domestic design in the social context of postwar Minnesota.</p>
